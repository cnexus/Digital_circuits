<h1>Digital Files</h1>
<p>Here you will find my digital circuits that I created using MultiMedia Logic (http://sourceforge.net/projects/multimedialogic/) back in my 9th grade (freshman) year at Poolesville High School.</p>

<p>These files have various functions, such as implementing adders using only logic gates, implementing binary -> decimal conversion using an LED gate, etc. 

I hope you enjoy exploring the things I did back when I was 14!</p>
